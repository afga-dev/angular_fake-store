## Technology Stack

This application was developed using a modern, containerized front-end stack centered around Angular for robust architecture and Docker for reliable environment management.

- **Front-End Framework:** Angular (TypeScript)
- **Styling and UI:** Bootstrap and custom styling
- **Data Persistence:** `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Deployment:** Netlify

## Key Features

- **E-commerce Simulation:** A fully functional, client-side simulation of an online store that fetches dynamic product data from an external API.
- **Dynamic Shopping Cart:** Drawer-style cart for a seamless UX â€” supports quick add/remove actions and quantity updates.
- **Simulated Authentication:** Mock login system using `localStorage` for user session handling.
- **Global Search:** A persistent search bar that filters and redirects users to relevant products instantly.
- **On-Demand PDF Invoice Generation:** Generates a professional, itemized invoice upon checkout.
- **Client-Side Persistence:** Uses browser storage APIs to preserve cart and session data across reloads.
- **Responsive UI:** A fully responsive layout optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## API and Data Architecture

This application integrates with the public <a href="https://fakestoreapi.com/">Fake Store API</a> for product and user data, while using client-side persistence for all transactions.

### Data Source

- **Base URL:** `https://fakestoreapi.com`
- **Endpoints:**
  - `POST /auth/login` â€“ Authentication
  - `GET /products` â€“ Product data
  - `GET /users/{id}` â€“ User data

### Client-Side Persistence Model

Although the <a href="https://fakestoreapi.com/">Fake Store API</a> supports `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests, it doesn't persist changes server-side. To provide a realistic simulation:

- `localStorage`: Persists active cart contents and mock user profiles between sessions.
- `sessionStorage`: Temporarily stores order details post-checkout for invoice generation (data persists until the tab is closed).
